| [Treiber Stack](src/treiber_stack.mli)             | A classic multi-producer multi-consumer stack, robust and flexible. Recommended starting point when needing LIFO structure                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Michael-Scott Queue](src/michael_scott_queue.mli) | A classic multi-producer multi-consumer queue, robust and flexible.

| [Chase-Lev Work-Stealing Deque](src/ws_deque.mli)  | Single-producer, multi-consumer dynamic-size double-ended queue (deque). Ideal for throughput-focused scheduling using per-core work distribution. Note, `pop` and `steal` follow different ordering (respectively LIFO and FIFO) and have different linearization contraints. | [Dynamic circular work-stealing deque](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1073970.1073974) and [Correct and efficient work-stealing for weak memory models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2442516.2442524)) |
| [SPSC Queue](src/spsc_queue.mli)                   | Simple single-producer single-consumer fixed-size queue. Thread-safe as long as at most one thread acts as producer and at most one as consumer at any single point in time.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [MPMC Relaxed Queue](src/mpmc_relaxed_queue.mli)   | Multi-producer, multi-consumer, fixed-size relaxed queue. Optimised for high number of threads. Not strictly FIFO. Note, it exposes two interfaces: a lockfree and a non-lockfree (albeit more practical) one. See the mli for details.                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [MPSC Queue](src/mpsc_queue.mli)                   | A multi-producer, single-consumer, thread-safe queue without support for cancellation. This makes a good data structure for a scheduler's run queue. It is used in [Eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio).                                                              | It is a single consumer version of the queue described in [Implementing lock-free queues](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~jacklange/teaching/cs2510-f12/papers/implementing_lock_free.pdf).                      |

## Usage

saturn can be installed from `opam`: `opam install saturn`. Sample usage of
`Ws_deque` is illustrated below.

```ocaml
module Ws_deque = Ws_deque.M

let q = Ws_deque.create ()

let () = Ws_deque.push q 100

let () = assert (Ws_deque.pop q = 100)
```

## Tests

Several kind of tests are provided for each data structure:

- unitary tests and `qcheck` tests: check semantics and expected behaviors with
  one and more domains;
- `STM` tests: check _linearizability_ for two domains (see
  [multicoretests library](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicoretests));
- `dscheck`: checks _non-blocking_ property for as many domains as wanted (for
  two domains most of the time). See
  [dscheck](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/dscheck).

See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more details.

## Benchmarks

There is a number of benchmarks in `bench` directory. You can run them with
`make bench`. See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) for more details.
