(**
    Michael-Scott classic multi-producer multi-consumer queue.

   All functions are lockfree. It is the recommended starting point
   when needing FIFO structure. It is inspired by {{:
   https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf}
   Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent
   Queue Algorithms}.
*)

type 'a t
(** The type of lock-free queue. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t
(** Create a new queue, which is initially empty. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** [is_empty q] returns empty if [q] is empty. *)

val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [push q v] pushes [v] to the back of the queue. *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a option
(** [pop q] pops an element [e] from the front of the queue and returns
    [Some v] if the queue is non-empty. Otherwise, returns [None]. *)

val clean_until : 'a t -> ('a -> bool) -> unit
(** [clean_until q f] drops the prefix of the queue until the element [e],
    where [f e] is [true]. If no such element exists, then the queue is
    emptied. *)

type 'a cursor
(** The type of cursor. *)

val snapshot : 'a t -> 'a cursor
(** Obtain a snapshot of the queue. This is a constant time operation. *)

val next : 'a cursor -> ('a * 'a cursor) option
(** [next c] returns [Some (e, c')] where [e] is the head of the queue and
    [c'] is the tail, if the queue is non-empty. Otherwise, returns [None]. *)
